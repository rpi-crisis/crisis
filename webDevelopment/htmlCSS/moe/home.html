                18, single and striving. Chasing the bag for so long, got no time for 
                relationships. The grind never stops. We are publishing some of our 
                songs on Soundcloud and soon to be hitting the Spotify market. We will 
                soon dominate the whole music industry. I'm GUNNA be like GUNNA, Sold 
                Out Dates, but in instead I be selling out shows, ahahahaha, just a 
                little bit of bars for you guys. on a real note tho, you guys should 
                check out my music, you won't be disappointed.
            </p>


            <p> I am a funny guy who is dorming with possibly the hottest asian I have 
                ever seen. I am a Computer Science major at RPI. I am trying to become 
                the next Drake since he is my idol, but I cannot rap as good as him yet. 
                Right now, I have a lot of goals, but the first step would definitely be 
                improving at League of Legends. Not many people know this, but I have a 
                friend who is Challenger in League of Legends, so I want to be like him. 
                I have asked him to give me some lessons, that way I can improve, but he 
                constantly tells me no and that I have to pay him. Whatever, we will see 
                who is the true loser once I make it big with my music. Support me, and 
                let's be better, together!

            <h3 class="section_header">Why I'm Single?</h3>
            <p>
                I do not know exactly why I am single, but I just do not have time for 
                relationships. At least that is what I tell myself to feel good about 
                myself. But yeah, I am making so much money right now, I will soon be 
                doing a $25 roblox card giveaway, only my first 100 streamers will get 
                it! Sign up guys, you do not want to miss out on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Funny story though, my first love was actually from Roblox, her name 
                was Melinda. She was the most perfect thing I have ever single, every 
                pixel of her. She made me so happy. I just have not seen her face, and 
                I am devastated because of it. But things happen, there is not much I 
                can do to retreive her. She just has to be an ever-lasting memory now. 
                I am working on finding a girlfriend, hopefully the right one comes up 
                to me and tells me how much she loves me because I am craving for some 
                love.
