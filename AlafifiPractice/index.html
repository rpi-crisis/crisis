            "Napoleon complex" is a theorized inferiority complex normally attributed to people of short stature. It is
            characterized by overly-aggressive or domineering social behavior, such as lying about earnings, and carries
            the implication that such behavior is compensatory for the subject's physical or social shortcomings.
            In psychology, the Napoleon complex is regarded as a derogatory social stereotype.

            The Napoleon complex is named after Napoleon, the first Emperor of the French. Common folklore supposes that
            Napoleon compensated for his lack of height by seeking power, war, and conquest. This view was fostered and
            encouraged by the British, who waged a propaganda campaign to diminish their enemy in print and art, during
            his life and after his death. In 1803, he was mocked in British newspapers as a short-tempered small man.
            Other names for the purported condition include Napoleonic complex, Napoleon syndrome and short man syndrome.
